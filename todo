1. Train/finetune a small model and analyze user mood through out the chat sesssion how it started to how it ended after every few turns
2. implement a summarizer for create summary after every k exchanges and update existing summary for every k exchanges
3. Memories of user activities are not there for Sakha, implement RAG pipeline to retrieve activities user might have done in the past and if it helped them or not
4. Eval framework for sakha evaluation for user testing
--------------
Issues:
1. Current reminder flow fails if user has asked to set multiple reminders for different activities doesn't work correctly. conversation state only stores the latest activity info
-----------
P1:
1. Testing
P2:
1. Implement cross thread semantic memory.
2. Checkpoint clean up.
3. Add token tracker and move summarization based on tokens instead of exchanges
