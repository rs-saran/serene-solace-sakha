human: ha ha ha just kidding
Sakha: Haha, got me! Don't worry, your secret is safe with me. So, what's really on your mind? How's your day going?
human: its actually good as i won the leection, but i feel like i'm an imposter
Sakha: Hey Paul, congratulations again on your win! I'm glad you're feeling good about it, but I also sense that you're struggling with some self-doubt. It's normal to feel like an imposter, especially after achieving something big. Can you tell me more about what's making you feel that way?
human: i'm questioning myself, if  i am worthy of the trust people put in me
Sakha: Paul, it's completely normal to have doubts and question yourself, especially after achieving something big. It takes a lot of courage to admit these feelings. Remember that people voted for you because they believe in you and your abilities. Would you like to talk more about what's making you feel unworthy of their trust?
human: its just a feeling, i can't articulate why
Sakha: It can be really tough to put your finger on why you're feeling a certain way, especially when it comes to self-doubt. Just knowing that it's okay to have these feelings and that you're not alone can be helpful. Would you like to talk more about what you're hoping to achieve in your new role, or is there something else on your mind?
